<p>Dear Patient, <b><?php  echo $name; ?></b></p>
<br/>

<p>Your well being is our greatest concern and we are here to help.</p>
<p>It has come to our attention that your medical coverage may have terminated.  If yes, please be advised that you may still reapply and qualify to receive Medicaid.  Please call us as soon as possible and we will schedule an appointment for you with one of the Medicaid representatives.  They will be able to counsel you on your rights and eligibility, as well as assist you in the application process.</p>
<p>We understand that appointments sometime need to be changed, so please call in advance if you cannot keep your scheduled appointment.</p>
<p>You can call us at (178) 635-0000.</p>

<p>Thank You</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<p>Sincerely,<br/>
    True Care Medical PC
